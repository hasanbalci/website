I am a PhD candidate in [Department of Computer Engineering](http://w3.cs.bilkent.edu.tr/en/) at [Bilkent University](https://w3.bilkent.edu.tr/bilkent/) under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Ugur Dogrusoz](http://www.cs.bilkent.edu.tr/~ugur/).

My research interests lie in the field of graph visualization and layout algorithms with a special focus on

- force-directed and spectral layout algorithms
- complexity management of large graphs
- development of user-friendly graph visualization tools
- dynamic graph visualization
